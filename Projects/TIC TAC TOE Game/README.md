# Tic Tac Toe Game 

In this game project, I coded the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
The game need 2 players to run the game. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. 
It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
